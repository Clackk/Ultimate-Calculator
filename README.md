# Ultimate-Calculator

A handy, totally useful Python calculator




more specifically...
A Python based calculator written upon my earlier created shrek calculator which was based upon a meme, the premise being that the day could be measured by how many times you could watch shrek in 24 hours. each time passing equivalent to the movie's length would be a "shrek" and would be counted like hours. (Around 18 shreks fit in a day). From there I expanded to add a fly to horsepower converter and a few other extremely useful programs. Thennnn I deleted all of it on accident and started over. So here we are!

This program is still very rough around the edges and I am still trying to get a good grip on Python as a whole. Please feel free to suggest bug fixes or new features as desired!

Pretty, right?
This program currently has an executable available, however the most up to date will be from the main uc2.py file.
