# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I will support security fixes of all older versions, however I will mainly be concerned with the security of the latest release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please either raise an issue immediately, or if you prefer due to security reasons, write me an email at caeden0452@gmail.com

Truth be told there shouldn't be anymore security issues with this calculator compared to a physical handheld calculator as it does not require or connect to the internet and does not interact with the filesystems it runs on, however in an effort to cover all my bases, I will always provide support for any percieved saftey threats.
